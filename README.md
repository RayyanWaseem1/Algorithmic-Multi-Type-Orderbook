# Multi-Type-Orderbook
## Creating a multi-type orderbook using C++. Trying to connect it to the Alpaca trading platform to conduct actual trades. Using some basic trades, I want to implement a algorithmic trading strategy using some ML methodologies to then go back and recurrently execute future trades based on this strategy.
