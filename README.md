# Multi-Type-Orderbook
## Creating a multi-type orderbook using C++. Trying to connect it to the Alpaca trading platform to conduct actual trades. Using some basic trading strategies as training data, I want to implement an algorithmic trading strategy to then go back and recurrently execute future trades based on this strategy.
